# “Stock Advisory”


**Introduction**

We are a Stock Advisory Group looking to forecast the next big stock opportunities for our clients that are under $100 a share. This simulates from information from the end of December 2015 (12/31/15)  for recommendation. To reach this conclusion, we research the criteria for selecting stocks based on this range. We took the criteria and narrowed it down for what we felt are the essential 6 areas to reach this conclusion. Based on a priority ranking created, we cross reference the top 5  selected stocks  and run them to today’s stock results to conclude if they were successful recommendations.

**Questions & Data**

We first pulled that Final Closing Ticker for the end of 2015 (12-31-2015) all stock criteria inclusive. Based on this data pulled, we narrowed the stock criteria down to a core set to evaluate the stocks. We created, cleaned and merged data to .csv & into a central folder to retrieve from. 

**Cleaning Our Dataset**

The project is broken down over 5 Notebooks to reach our conclusion and results.
	-Cleaning/Merging of Data: pulled from our data folder (.csv)
	-Picking Stocks: calculated by our weighted ranking system
	-Investment Distribution: calculated from the recommended stock     values by strength.	
	-Stock Analysis: breaks down the individually selected stocks 
	-Api Call for Current Stock Prices: to call for the current closing prices of the selected stocks for comparison and well as Return on Investment (ROI) results. 


**What are the key criterias to select the next “successful” stock???**

1. Working Capital Ratio 
2. Earnings per Share
3. Debt to Equity Ratio 
4. Price to Equity Ratio
5. Profit Margin
6. Quick Ratio

**Diversify Portfolio**

Based on our research, we created a priority ranking based on our _6 selected criteria_ to narrow selection down to the top 5 stocks to recommend.
* Yahoo (YAHOO) - 35%
* Frontier Communication (FTR) - 30%
* Akamai Technologies (AKAM) - 15%
* Edward Lifesciences (EW) - 10%
* EBay Austria (GmbH) (EBAY) - 10%


**Top Stock Price Growth/Conclusion**

- Yahoo stopped trading in 2017 when was bought by Verizon.
- The stocks were strong on the short term growth but took a slide as time went on. Overall, a 20% growth in 5 years does not reflect a strong protfolio. 
- Despite selecting core criterias for selection of these stocks, there was more to consider to select the next value stock investment such as intuision and other non- statstical parameters.
